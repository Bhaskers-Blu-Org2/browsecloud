# What is BrowseCloud?
It's a laborious task to collect and synthesize the perspectives of customers.
There's an immense number of digital channels to gather information from customers: survey data, StackOverflow, Reddit, email, etc.
Even for internal tools teams at Microsoft, there are at least 10,000 user feedback documents generated per quarter.

To help solve this problem, BrowseCloud is an application that summarizes feedback data via smart word clouds, called counting grids.
On a word cloud, the size of the text simply scales with the frequency of the word.
Text is scattered randomly on word clouds. In BrowseCloud, we have a word cloud where the position of the word matters.
As the user scans along the visualization, themes smoothly transition between each other.
